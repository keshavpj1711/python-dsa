## List of Basic DSAs:

- **Linked List:** Linear data structures where elements are stored in nodes, with each node pointing to the next.
- **Array**: Collections of elements stored in contiguous memory locations, accessible by indices.
- **Hash Map**: Data structures that provide fast insertion, deletion, and lookup operations using hash functions.
- **Stack**: Linear data structures that follow the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
- **Queue**: Linear data structures that follow the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Used frequently in Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms.
- **Sorting**: Algorithms that arrange elements in a particular order (ascending or descending). Often paired with Binary Search and Greedy algorithms.

Since our target here is not basic DSA we will only cover them in small question like the ones given below

## Getting Started with Basic DSAs

- Two Sum - Array, Hash Map
- Reverse Linked List - Linked List
- Number of Recent Calls - Queue
- Valid Parentheses - Stack
- Array Partition - Sorting

> Each of these questions can be found on Leetcode
