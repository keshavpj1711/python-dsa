# How to Study?

## What NOT?

- There are many things you can study, but not all of them are useful. 
- For example, you can spend days studying how to implement a complex algorithm like Burrows-Wheeler,
  - but that's not going to help you in a coding interview either because it's too complex and academic and nobody expects you to use that during an interview.

> it's a race you can't win by sheer volume.

## What Interviewers Look For

While qualities like communication and culture fit can be polished quickly, honing your technical skills requires dedicated preparation.

Couple of imp things that interviewers look for are: 
- Exceptional problem-solving abilities
  - essence of problem-solving is to draw from familiar challenges when faced with unfamiliar ones
- Producing bug-free code
  - the knack for writing flawless code is achieved through relentless practice

## Patterns 

### Why patterns are important?

- Because we don't know what we don't know, humans can only infer from what we know. 
- If a problem requires prior knowledge and we don't have that knowledge, then it's essentially intractable.
