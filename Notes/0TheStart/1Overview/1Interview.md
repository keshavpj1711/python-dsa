# Modern Interview

## The Interview Structure

### A typical coding interview follows this format:

1. **Introduction (5 minutes):**\
  Your interviewer, usually a senior engineer, will begin with casual questions about your background. This is your opportunity to briefly highlight relevant projects and experience while **showing genuine interest in the company**.

2. **Coding Session (30-45 minutes):**\
  You'll receive access to a coding environmentâ€”whether it's HackerRank, CoderPad, or even a simple Google Doc. This is where the main assessment happens.

3. **Wrap-Up and Questions (5-10 minutes):**\
  If time permits, you'll have a chance to ask questions about the role and team. This is also an opportunity to demonstrate your enthusiasm and cultural fit.

## What you'll be asked 

### Question Sources and Types 

- **Large tech companies:** Typically use LeetCode-style questions from their proprietary question banks. The company-tagged problems on LeetCode are generally accurate indicators.
- **Small to mid-sized companies:** Often rely on standard interview question collections like the "Blind 75."

## A Small Basic Example 

Here's a video you can refer to get a basic idea on how you can perform in an interview the steps and what's and why's etc.: [Youtube video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LTFPReL8O8)

## Leetcode v/s The Real Deal 

|Leetcode|Real Interview|
|---|---|
|Test cases provided|You create your own test cases|
|Runtime is compared against all other users|Runtime still matters, but you're evaluated on your approach, not ranked against others|
|Typing silently is okay|Communication is essential|
|Code only needs to work|Code should be clean, documented, and maintainable|

## How Interviewers Grade you?

1. **Algorithmic Thinking**: Can you apply appropriate data structures and algorithms with reasonable time/space complexity?
2. **Problem-Solving Autonomy**: Do you find logical steps forward independently, or require constant hints?
3. **Communication Skills**: Are you clearly articulating (articulate: ability to speak) your thought process and approach?
4. **Code Quality**: Is your solution well-structured, readable, and maintainable?

## Some Tips to keep in mind

- Learn Patterns not problems
- Practice in realistic interview conditions (time contraints and similar environments)
- Master common algo templates (like BFS, DFS, binary search, etc)
- Focus on communication: 
  - Even when you are practicing/studying alone explain your approaches out loud 
- Review detailed editorial solutions
