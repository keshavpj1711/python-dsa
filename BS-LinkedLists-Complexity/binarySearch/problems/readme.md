# Optional Question

## Handling repeating numbers
So far we've assumed that the numbers in the list are unique. 
What if the numbers can repeat? E.g. [5, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]. 
Can you modify your solution to handle this special case?

## Searching in a Rotated List
You are given list of numbers, obtained by rotating a sorted list an unknown number of times. 
You are also given a target number. 
Write a function to find the position of the target number within the rotated list. 
You can assume that all the numbers in the list are unique.

Example: In the rotated sorted list [5, 6, 9, 0, 2, 3, 4], the target number 2 occurs at position 5.
