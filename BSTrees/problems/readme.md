## Problem 1 

The problem at end:

> **QUESTION 1**: As a senior backend engineer at Jovian, you are tasked with developing a fast in-memory data structure to manage profile information (username, name and email) for 100 million users. It should allow the following operations to be performed efficiently:
> 
> 1. **Insert** the profile information for a new user.
> 2. **Find** the profile information of a user, given their username
> 3. **Update** the profile information of a user, given their usrname
> 5. **List** all the users of the platform, sorted by username
>
> You can assume that usernames are unique. 

### Solution 1

Using the list sorted by username is the most basic approach we can have. In this case the Time Complexity Analysis would be: 
- Insert: O(N)
- Find: O(N)
- Update: O(N)
- List: O(1)
